## Instructions

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. We would love to see you show off your creativity!


## Data

The data of the Major European stock indices from 1991-1998 will be used.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
data("EuStockMarkets")
stocks <- as.data.frame(EuStockMarkets) %>%
  gather(index, price) %>%
  mutate(time = rep(time(EuStockMarkets), 4))
```

## Plot

Plot the data.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(stocks, x = ~time, y = ~price, color = ~index, mode = "lines")
```
